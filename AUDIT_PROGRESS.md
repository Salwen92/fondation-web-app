# Audit Implementation Progress Tracker

## Worktree Setup
- **Branch**: `audit/critical-fixes`
- **Worktree Path**: `/Users/salwen/Documents/Cyberscaling/fondation-audit-improvements`
- **Base Commit**: `0bf4e7c` (feat: add comprehensive audit reports)

## Quality Assurance Rules
### Code Quality Standards
- ✅ No `console.log` statements (use structured logging)
- ✅ No `any` types without explicit reason and type narrowing
- ✅ All functions must have proper TypeScript types
- ✅ Components <200 lines, functions <50 lines
- ✅ Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured
- ✅ No hardcoded URLs or magic numbers

### Testing Requirements
- ✅ TypeScript compilation must pass (`bun run typecheck`)
- ✅ Linting must pass (`bun run lint`)
- ✅ All existing functionality must remain intact
- ✅ New code must follow existing patterns and conventions

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Production Fixes (PRIORITY 1)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days
**Branch**: `audit/critical-fixes`

#### 1.1 Fix Hardcoded URLs ✅
- [x] `src/components/repos/repo-card.tsx:106` - Replace localhost callback URL

- **COMPLETED**: Full Scaleway Jobs API integration implemented with proper error handling

### Phase 2: High Priority Code Quality (PRIORITY 2)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Estimated Time**: 4-5 days
**Branch**: `audit/code-quality`

#### 2.1 Refactor RepoCard Component ✅
- [x] Extract `JobStatusBadge` component
- [x] Extract `JobActions` component  
- [x] Extract `ProgressBar` component
- [x] Create `useJobManagement` hook
- [x] Create translation utilities
- **COMPLETED**: RepoCard refactored from 370 lines to 167 lines

#### 2.2 Implement Structured Logging ✅
- [x] Create `src/lib/logger.ts` with levels and formatting
- [x] Replace all `console.*` statements
- [x] Add request/response logging for API routes
- [x] Configure production logging strategy
- **COMPLETED**: Structured logging with context and levels implemented

### Phase 3: Type Safety Improvements (PRIORITY 3)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days
**Branch**: `audit/type-safety`

#### 3.1 Eliminate Remaining `any` Types ✅
- [x] Fix `convex/docs.ts:348` - Use proper Convex ID type
- [x] Fix `convex/cloudRun.ts:25` - Use proper partial update type
- [x] Fix `convex/schema.ts:42` - Replace `v.any()` with proper union
- **COMPLETED**: All `any` types removed with proper type safety

#### 3.2 Add Runtime Validation ✅
- [x] Add Zod schemas for API endpoints
- [x] Implement validation middleware
- [x] Add proper error responses for validation failures
- **COMPLETED**: Full runtime validation with Zod schemas and middleware

### Phase 4: UX Enhancements (PRIORITY 4)
**Status**: ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
**Estimated Time**: 5-6 days  
**Branch**: `audit/ux-improvements`

#### 4.1 User-Friendly Error Handling ✅
- [x] Create `src/lib/error-messages.ts` with user-friendly mappings
- [x] Implement error boundary components
- [x] Add retry mechanisms and recovery options
- [x] Test all error scenarios
- **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive error handling with French translations

#### 4.2 Enhanced Loading States ⏸️ SKIPPED
- [ ] Create skeleton loader components
- [ ] Add loading states to all async operations
- [ ] Implement progress communication improvements
- [ ] Test loading experience
- **NOTE**: Skipped per user request

## Quality Checkpoints

### Before Each Commit
- [ ] Run `bun run typecheck` - Must pass
- [ ] Run `bun run lint` - Must pass  
- [ ] Run `bun run check` - Must pass
- [ ] Manual testing of affected functionality
- [ ] Code review against quality standards above

### Before Each Phase Completion
- [ ] Full application smoke test
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] No regressions in functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed

## Progress Tracking Mechanism

### Daily Updates
- Update this file with progress on each item
- Use ✅ for completed, 🟡 for in progress, ❌ for not started
- Record any blockers or decisions made
- Note any deviations from plan with reasoning

### Branch Management
- Each phase gets its own branch
- Regular commits with clear messages following conventional commit format
- Rebase onto main before creating PRs
- Squash commits for clean history

## Recovery & Continuity Plan

### If Context is Lost
1. Read this progress file first
2. Check current branch and worktree location
3. Review recent commits for context
4. Check TodoWrite tool for current tasks
5. Resume from last incomplete checkpoint

### Quality Assurance Recovery
1. Always run full test suite before continuing
2. Reference audit reports in `docs/audit-report/` for context
3. Check against quality rules listed above
4. When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than guess
