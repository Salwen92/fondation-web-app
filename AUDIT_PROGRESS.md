# Audit Implementation Progress Tracker

## Worktree Setup
- **Branch**: `audit/critical-fixes`
- **Worktree Path**: `/Users/salwen/Documents/Cyberscaling/fondation-audit-improvements`
- **Base Commit**: `0bf4e7c` (feat: add comprehensive audit reports)

## Quality Assurance Rules
### Code Quality Standards
- ✅ No `console.log` statements (use structured logging)
- ✅ No `any` types without explicit reason and type narrowing
- ✅ All functions must have proper TypeScript types
- ✅ Components <200 lines, functions <50 lines
- ✅ Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Environment variables properly configured
- ✅ No hardcoded URLs or magic numbers

### Testing Requirements
- ✅ TypeScript compilation must pass (`bun run typecheck`)
- ✅ Linting must pass (`bun run lint`)
- ✅ All existing functionality must remain intact
- ✅ New code must follow existing patterns and conventions

## Quality Checkpoints

### Before Each Commit
- [ ] Run `bun run typecheck` - Must pass
- [ ] Run `bun run lint` - Must pass  
- [ ] Run `bun run check` - Must pass
- [ ] Manual testing of affected functionality
- [ ] Code review against quality standards above

### Before Each Phase Completion
- [ ] Full application smoke test
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] No regressions in functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed

## Progress Tracking Mechanism

### Daily Updates
- Update this file with progress on each item
- Use ✅ for completed, 🟡 for in progress, ❌ for not started
- Record any blockers or decisions made
- Note any deviations from plan with reasoning

### Branch Management
- Each phase gets its own branch
- Regular commits with clear messages following conventional commit format
- Rebase onto main before creating PRs
- Squash commits for clean history

## Recovery & Continuity Plan

### If Context is Lost
1. Read this progress file first
2. Check current branch and worktree location
3. Review recent commits for context
4. Check TodoWrite tool for current tasks
5. Resume from last incomplete checkpoint

### Quality Assurance Recovery
1. Always run full test suite before continuing
2. Reference audit reports in `docs/audit-report/` for context
3. Check against quality rules listed above
4. When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than guess
