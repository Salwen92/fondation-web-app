summary: |
  This project is a **sophisticated code analysis tool** that generates *interactive educational tutorials* from codebases. It uses **Claude AI** to automatically analyze code, extract key abstractions and patterns, determine optimal learning paths, and create beginner-friendly chapters that teach how the codebase works. The tool provides a *real-time terminal interface* with progress tracking, making complex code analysis transparent and user-friendly.
